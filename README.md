# Firebase-TrainSchedule

In this coding bootcamp assignment, we were tasked with creating a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. 

I chose to use bootstrap for my html layout and added a javascript plugin called flipclock to give a train station effect to the user experience. User input is saved on Firebase and users can remove trains from the site, however, the information is still preserved on Firebase. 

Future functionality is to update the javascript so train times are updated dynamically on the page.
